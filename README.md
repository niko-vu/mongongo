# Mongongo

## Description

An API for a social network web app where users can share, react to others' shared posts, and create a friend list using Express.js, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM.

I'm still struggling with this project!! But really fighting with MongoDB/mongoose is really helping me learn about it. Currently a work-in-progress, but hoping to finish it soon with the help of tutoring! :)

## Usage

The deployed application should look something like this:
